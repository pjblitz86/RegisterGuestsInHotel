Write a program to register guests in a hotel.
The program must be implemented in the Java ( pure Java ) programming language.

Requirements:
The hotel has 5 single rooms. The rooms are numbered from 1 to 5.
No more than one guest lives in one hotel room.

Guest details:
- Name
- Surname

Possible actions:
1. Guest registration. The required information is the name and surname of the guest.
   The system itself selects the ship's room and informs the guest.
   If there are no rooms available at the moment, the guest will be replied.

2. Check-out of the guest.

3. Room occupancy review - occupied rooms and who lives in them are listed.

4. History and status of the room - show the names and surnames of all guests who have stayed in order.
   Showroom status - available or occupied.

You can use the user interface of your choice (choose only one):
Text mode - command line.
Graphical interface - Java Swing, or awt.
Web interface.

Additional but not required functionality:
Save the summarized data so that the data does not have to be summarized after transferring the application.
